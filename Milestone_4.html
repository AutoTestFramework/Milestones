        <hr/>
        <p>After we performed face-to-face interviews with our potential customers, we concluded that our wishes are:
            <p>
                <p>Saves time and money. Automation testing is faster in execution
                    <p>
                        <p>Reusability of code. Create one time and execute multiple times with less or no maintenance
                            <p>
                                <p>Easy reporting. It generates automatic reports after test execution
                                    <p>
                                        <p>Easy for compatibility testing. It enables parallel execution in combination of different OS and browser environments
                                            <p>
                                                <p>Low cost maintenance. It is cheaper compared to manual testing in a long run
                                                    <p>
                                                        <p>Automated testing is more reliable
