        </br></br><h2><b>Determine the volume of your target market (including the different sub-markets)</b></h2></br>

        <p>Establishing our target market consists of three steps:</p>
        <p>1. Market segmentation</p>
            <b>Demographic segmentation: age, gender, education and income</b>
            <li>Our target market are IT corporations, with employees between the ages of 22 and 45, in the middle income group.</li>
            <b>Geographical segmentation:</b>
            <li>In the initial phase, we plan to launch locally, in Bucharest. Afterwards, we will extend on a global scale.</li>
            <b>Behaviouristic segmentation: lifestyle, interests and belief system variables</b>
            <li>Complex applications where architects decide comprehensive automated testing is requried.</li>
        <p>Evaluation and the target-market decision</p>
            <li>Focus our marketing campaigns on a specific segment. The choice was governed by things such as accessiblity (for advertising purposes) and size (to generate enough profits).
            If most customers (size) in an area have no knowledge in QA automation, it is logical to buy (accesibility) a product that may help them, as this will generate more sales and profits.
        <p>Market positioning</p>
            Because we want to be succesfful entrepreneurs, we are choosing to go for a large share in ONE segment, rather than a small share in the total market. It;s preferable and realistic to focus on one segment only.

        ATF wants to sell a new automated testing framework to IT corporations. There are 2000 IT corporations and the average annual income per employee is 1000$. On average, IT corporations spend 40% of their income on tools and QA testers. We are convinced that we will attract 5% market share, as there are already many other similar tools and also other competitors where the corporations go first. What is the potential rand value of this market?

        <p>The size of the market:</p>

        <li>1. <b>Number of customer units (1):</b> 2000</li>
        <li>2. <b>Average annual gross income per unit (2):</b> 1000</li>
        <li>3. <b>Total income for area (1 x 2 = 3):</b> 2.000.000</li>
        <li>4. <b>Percentage (%) of income spent on item (4):</b> 40%</li>
        <li>5. <b>Potential rand value for item (3 x 4 = 5):</b> 800.000</li>
        <li>6. <b>Realistic percentage (%) of entrepreneur's market share (6):</b> 5%</li>
        <li>7. <b>Rand value of entrepreneur's market share (5 x 6 = 7):</b> 40.000</li>

        <i>The results of market research show that men between the ages of 20 and 45 are most likely to buy the product. In this case, it is obvious to focus on men in this age group.</i></p>

<p> Considering the large number of competitors we can conclude that launching on the market will be difficult,
   but we are confident that our feature choices will convince a consistent number of people to choose our product.</p>
        We used: https://www.bizbuysell.com/ & https://www.bizquest.com/ to check which to determine how much businesses are selling for in your industry.
